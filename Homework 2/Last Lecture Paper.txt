This lecture made me feel fairly inspired. The upbeat nature of Randy despite his diagnosis and his thoughts on alternative teaching make a lot of sense along with his thoughts on overcoming obstacles. Brick walls are there to teach you how to overcome them because adaptation is so crucial to everyone's development and you can't develop if there are no obstacles to practice overcoming. I also enjoyed the point of how football and other sports for kids aren't mainly there to teach kids how to play the sport but are actually there to teach teamwork, discipline, and resilience which I heartily agree with. The story of him getting into the Imagineering workshop to work on the VR attractions was brilliant. Passing all those roadblocks and challenges to make that childhood dream a reality and having the strength to say no to that when he realized it was not what he really wanted was really surprising and admirable. I also think the way he handled his students with the VR exhibition after they exceeded his expectations was really excellent. The way they went above and beyond because they were truly passionate about what they were working on and it turned out so good for the time, especially by students. I hope some day I can relate to that passion for a work and be that excited about something I created by myself or with a team. I'd imagine a success like that feels even better as a team. My favorite part of this lecture, as mentioned earlier, was headfakes, the computer science application of it for Alice was a great idea. I believe teaching someone something without them knowing they are learning works incredibly well.
