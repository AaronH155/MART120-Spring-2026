I do believe that learning styles affect how we learn. There have been numerous studies that prove this along with my own personal experiences where I have been put in situations where I must learn either by way of auditory, visually, or tactile. I have always found that I am a tactile or Kinesthetic learner and I have known this since around fourth grade. I learn things by doing them, practicing and understanding how something works. Often if something is explained to me or shown to me I am able to get an extremely basic understanding, maybe surface level be able to replicate some action but I can't learn that way. Because of this, I was surprised that on the Education Planner quiz we had to take, I was labeled an auditory and visual learner which I know from experience is not the case. I think how someone learns is too individual and subject to change for it to be labeled once from a quiz. Many people have been found to be a mix of several as well so labeling someone one learning style and teaching them that way could be harmful to the outcome of their education.
