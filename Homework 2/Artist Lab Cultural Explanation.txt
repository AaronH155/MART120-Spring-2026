Artist Lab Statement

At first glance, this may appear to be an amalgamation of triangles making other shapes but that is simply incorrect. This work of art represents culture in several ways. The triangle serves as the foundation, being the strongest shape, the triangle represents that every culture has a strong history and support. The circle the triangles form represents the idea that despite all of the world's cultural differences, we are still all one people. The various randomized colors support this idea, we may be unified but we are all different in some way, but no matter what, we are one.
