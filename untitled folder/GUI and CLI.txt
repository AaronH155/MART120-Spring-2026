When computers and programming languages were a new technological marvel only few understood, the main way of controlling these machines was known as CLI or Command Line Interfaces. These Command Line Interfaces were efficient, direct, and difficult to understand for the average person. Granted, the technology of the time limited what was possible in computing and navigating which resulted in early GUIs or Graphic User Interfaces being created using text and symbols on the keyboard. In the 1980s, computers became significantly more mainstream and were beginning to be found in households and typical workplaces across the country. This meant that manufacturers had to come up with a way to make their operating systems more accessible to the average person which resulted in the creation of GUIs. This point and click system differed from the older CLI systems in several ways, it was easier to understand and was often used with a mouse instead of a keyboard removing the need for memorizing commands and understanding directories. Computers today still have the option to access a command line interface either through Apple's Terminal or Microsoft's Command Prompt which allows developers to control more advanced aspects of the computer through commands that may not be available in the operating system's GUI.
